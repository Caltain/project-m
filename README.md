# My first React project

This project is my first react prokject. It is nothing special, just a website designed to pass our final test.

## Purpose

This is a relatively simple service. When you are on the site you can make login/register or logout. You can add furniture and check the catalog. And there is an about me page to check who designed the site in this case - me :). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Server
I'am using softuni practice server. It is in the repository. To start it you need to go to it's directory and type node server.js to start it.
It is designed by Viktor if i am not missled. It is simple rest service that does the job. You can make CRUD operations and its relatively stable.
