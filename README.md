# My first React project

This project is my first react prokject. It is nothing special, just a website designed to pass my final test.

## Purpose

You can make register if you like. Whe registered and logged in you can search throught the listings for a furniture you like. When you find it you can like it, love it or if you realy like it you can reserve it. When reserved you can cancel reservation or just call the owner of the listing so you can get your item. You also can  send comments to the admin of the site. Only  he/she sees the comments. And you can learn more about the admin in the about page. You too can add furniture listings if you want in the create page.
If you don't want to register or log in you can simply check through the catalog and see what items are on. 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Server
I'am using softuni practice server. It is in the repository. To start it you need to go to it's directory type `cd server` and type `node server` to start it.
It is designed by Viktor if i am not missled. It is simple rest service that does the job. You can make CRUD operations and its relatively stable.
